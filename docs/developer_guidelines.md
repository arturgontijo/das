# Developer Guidelines

General guidelines and suggestions while working on DAS repositories.

## Pull Requests

While not currently enforced, we do want to link all PR's with it's own tracking issue at the [DAS Board]{https://github.com/orgs/singnet/projects/6}
As a general rule, your PR title must follow:
```
[#issue number] Concise, self-contained, explanatory title
```
